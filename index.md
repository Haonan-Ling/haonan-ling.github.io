We are a new, growing research group residing in the <a href="https://mae.ucf.edu/">Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department</a> at UCF. There are three research interests in our lab:
</p>

<ul style="font-size: 17px;">
    <li style="font-size: 17px;">Exploration of emerging van der Waals materials in nonlinear and quantum optics</li>
    <li style="font-size: 17px;">Processing and characterization of novel materials for electronic devices</li>
    <li style="font-size: 17px;">Composite materials for extreme environments</li>
</ul>
