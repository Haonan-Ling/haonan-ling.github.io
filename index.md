We are a new, growing research group residing in the <a href="https://mae.ucf.edu/">Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department</a> at UCF. There are two major research thrusts in our lab:
</p>

<ul style="font-size: 18px;">
    <li style="font-size: 18px;">Design, fabrication, and characterization of electronic and photonic devices based on novel material systems, including low-dimensional materials, phase change materials, superlattice structures, with improved capabilities.</li>
    <li style="font-size: 18px;">Understanding the energy transfer mechanism in newly emerging material platforms such as layered van der Waals materials via optical spectroscopic and microscopic techniques.</li>
</ul>
