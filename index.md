We are a new, growing research group residing in the [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department](https://mae.ucf.edu/) at UCF. There are two major research thrusts in our lab:
* Design, fabrication, and characterization of electronic and photonic devices based on novel material systems, including low dimensional materials, phase change materials, superlattice structures, with improved capabilities
* Understanding the energy transfer mechanism in newly emerging material platforms such as layered van der Waals materials via optical spectroscopic and microscopic techniques
